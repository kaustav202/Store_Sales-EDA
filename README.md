# Store_Sales-EDA

This project aims to analyse the sales patterns and customer behaviour with respect to choice of products and various categories of items across
a chain of stores in  3 different cities.<br/>
It also helps to break down the sales into various demographies and modes of shopping like payment methods.
This allows the business to form better strategies related to the products sections that should be given more impetus and also helps in the marketing campaigns.
